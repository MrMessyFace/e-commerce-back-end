# E-Commerce Back-End

## Description

I was tasked with creating a Node.js backend database app that uses Express and Sequelize to interact.

## Installation

I used Node.js, nodemon, Express.js, MySQL2, DotENV, and Sequelize.

## Usage

When you run the server, you can use Postman or Insomnia to read, create, update, and delete categories, products, and tags each.

## Credits

Code was assisted with by the instructional staff.
